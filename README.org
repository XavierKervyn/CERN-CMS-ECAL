* CERN-CMS-ECAL data analysis automation package
This package was created to analyse the data of the prototype of CMS ECAL for the upcoming high luminosity LHC upgrade. It is able to study the amplitude, the amplitude difference and the time difference between signals in the channels of the detector. The code is structured as a Python package, 'ecalautoanalysis', with three main classes: =Amplitude=, =Amplitude_Delta= and =Time_Delta=, each being subclasses of =ECAL=.

To install the package and its dependencies, type

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pip install -I .
#+END_EXAMPLE

within the =CERN-CMS-ECAL= folder in a command line. After modifications of the code, the package must be re-loaded for them to be effective. To avoid loading all the dependencies again, type

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pip install -I --no-deps .
#+END_EXAMPLE

instead. The subfolder =examples= contain different python scripts with the different methods implemented for each class for testing purposes. Calling one of these methods will result in the creation of a folder =Statistics= containing the =.csv= files with the data retrieved/computed in the code, as well as a folder =Plots= with the different plots in format =.html=, =.svg=, =.pdf= and =.png=.

When changing the fitting method (e.g. from =''synchronise''= to =='gaussian'==), one must make sure that the previous =Statistics= folder is either empty or inexistent. Otherwise, the code will just load the data and not re-generate them to save computation time. 

The main implementation choices that one could modify are listed below:
- for Amplitude: 
    - Discard events with amplitude > 40000 ADC counts when loading
    - Consider the gain that is the most present for each channel in the run
    - Mask for fitting in resolution plot, Amplitudes < 10000 ADC counts only. This is rather arbitrary and could be improved by setting the cutoff to the amplitude at which the minimum relative resolution is reached instead.
    - All parameters for gaussian fit supposed > 0

- for Time Delta:
    - Discard events for which |𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 Δ|>1000 clock periods
    - Fist guess for fits:
        Mean: bin_centers[np.argmax(hist)] “position of the maximum time delta in histogram”
        Sigma: period (ps) / 50
        Bounds (A, 𝜇, 𝜎) ∈ [0 →∞, mean guess ± period (ps)/4, 0 → period (ps)]
    - Multiple gaussians: only consider range (-2 periods, + 2 periods).

We invite the user to refer to the online documentation for the different keywords arguments of the methods.
