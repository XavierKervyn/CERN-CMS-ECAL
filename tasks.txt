// MAIN GOAL:
-study the linearity & (amplitude + time) resolution of the upgraded ECAL
-implement a way of generating plots in an automatic fashion

// TASKS:
-adapt board: nombre de boards actives?
-attribution des boards 'A', 'C', ect. quand on n'a qu'une seule board active?

-change units for amplitude
-throw exception if runs in the list included_runs are not cohrent (not the same boards)
-check save paths for statistics
-check save paths for plots
-check if h5 file generated to avoid generating it twice
-argparse
-standard dev = sqrt(variance)
-new method: evolution(spill) for a given run
-DAQ: knowing when the run is finished
-set single methods to private
-throw exception argument of Time or Amplitude is not a list of int
-test variation_plot_runs with a specific channel
-throw an exception when a list only has a single run for variation methods that require many runs
-check that the reference channel is included in channel_names
-throw an exception in statistics and plots variation if the h5 has not been generated yet
-change variation plots: board vs same board and board across boards (ex C3 vs all other channels)
-runs not sent to reco [EDIT: fixed]
-add another way of computing the time delta in compute_time_delta, without synchronizer (ex. 3 gaussians)
-implement similar methods to compute amplitude delta
-once method that check existence of h5 implemented, deploy in plots and colormesh to load h5 if already exists
